# Day 02 - Variables & Working With Text

### Concepts Learned
- Variables are labels that store values (text, numbers, data)
- Assigning values using `=`
- Printing variables using:
  - commas (auto spacing)
  - `+` for combining text
  - `*` for repetition
- Using variables inside print statements
- Combining variables and strings to create messages

### Practice Summary
I created variables (`name`, `course`, `mood`, `emoji`) and printed them in different ways:
- using commas
- using `+`
- using `*`
- combining operations in one line

### New Git Skill Today
- Learned how `.gitignore` works
- Created a `.gitignore` file for my repo
- Cleaned up unnecessary files from GitHub
- Now my repo only shows the important folders (notes, projects, scratchpad, daily-python)

## Debugging: When VS Code Wont Run Python Files
- If terminal shows >>>, I am inside the Python shell
- VS Code run button won’t work while inside Python
- Fix = type exit() or quit()
- Then run my file again normally
- Or use python3 file.py from the normal terminal

### Reflection
Today felt organized and smooth. Python variables make sense, and the text operations feel easy after yesterday’s lesson. My GitHub now looks clean and professional.
