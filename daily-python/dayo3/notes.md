# Day 03 - Working With Numbers & Real-World Calculations

### Concepts Learned
- Python numeric types: integers and floats
- Assigning numbers to variables
- Math operations in Python: +, -, *, /
- Using variables inside calculations
- Combining numbers using formulas
- Printing numeric results with commas

### Real-World Modeling
I learned how to use Python to calculate totals:
- tickets_total = price * quantity
- snacks_total = price * quantity
- overall_total = tickets_total + snacks_total

This makes Python feel practical and useful for real-life scenarios (shopping, budgeting, travel, etc.)

### Debugging Learned
- I accidentally typed `%` instead of a number
- Python cannot multiply by `%`
- Fixed by replacing `%` with the correct quantity (5)

### Reflection
Numbers feel easy to work with. Using variables makes calculations clean and organized. I can already use Python to model small real-world problems.
