Day 02 – Functions II: Return, Print & Early Return

### Concepts Learned
. A function can print something, return something, or both.
. print() creates a side effect (shows output but does not return data).
. return sends a value out of the function, so it can be stored, reused, or modified.
. A function stops immediately when it hits a return statement.
. Lines after return will not run (unreachable code).
. A “side effect” is when the function changes something outside itself (like printing).
. Pure functions return values; impure functions cause side effects.

### Return vs Print
. Print(): show something on the screen. Thats it. It is a side affect.
. Return: sends a value back to the caller, so the code can use it (store it, add to it, print it later....)

### Early return
Early return stopping the rest of the function when the condition is met. 
Early retunr is use for:
. avoiding unnessary work
. clearer logic
. simple validation

### Side Effects
A “side effect” is when a function affects the outside world:
. printing to the screen
. modifying a global variable
. writing to a file
. sending data elsewhere

Reflection
. Today I understood deeply how return works and how it differs from print.
. Early return made function flow much clearer.
. I learned that functions can have side effects, but pure functions are easier to test and reuse.
. I feel more confident writing real functions because I know exactly what they return and what they print.
