## 📘 Overview

This repository documents my academic journey through the **Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Business & AI pathway)**.

It is organized to reflect a real university program, with coursework structured by **academic year, term, course, and week**. Each folder represents not just completed work, but the progression of my technical thinking, problem-solving approach, and software design skills over time.

This repository serves as both:

* a structured academic record, and
* a practical portfolio demonstrating applied computer science fundamentals.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository follows a consistent, academic-first structure:

```
academic-year-01/
└── term01/
    ├── python101-foundations/
    │   ├── week01/
    │   ├── week02/
    │   ├── week03/
    │   └── weekly-projects/
    ├── notes/
    └── scratchpad/
```

### Structure Principles

* Organized by **Academic Year → Term → Course → Week**
* Projects live within the course that produced them
* This structure will remain consistent across future terms and academic years

---

## 🧪 Weekly Projects

Courses follow a **single evolving project model** rather than isolated assignments.

A core project is introduced early and expanded weekly as new concepts are learned. Each iteration reflects increased complexity, improved structure, and stronger design decisions.

Typical progression:

* **Week 01:** Core logic and initial implementation
* **Week 02:** Refactoring, functions, and control flow
* **Week 03:** Validation, structure, and maintainability

This mirrors real-world software development through iteration and refinement.

---

## 🧠 Learning Approach

My learning approach emphasizes:

* hands-on experimentation
* iterative improvement
* clear, maintainable code
* understanding how foundational concepts scale over time

Course notes are written in my own words and maintained alongside projects to demonstrate **conceptual understanding**, not memorization.

---

## 🎯 Academic & Career Focus

My studies focus on building strong foundations in:

* computer science principles
* structured problem-solving
* applied Python programming
* preparation for AI- and business-driven systems

I am particularly interested in roles that intersect:

* Computer Science
* Artificial Intelligence
* Business systems
* Human-centered software design

This repository represents the early foundation of that path.

## 📝 Progress Snapshot

* **Week 01:** Python fundamentals — variables, booleans, comparisons
* **Week 02:** Control flow — `if / elif / else`, membership operators
* **Week 03:** Strings, lists, dictionaries, and safe data handling

Progress will continue to be documented as coursework advances.
