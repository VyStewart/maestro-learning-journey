# Maestro Learning Journey

Dec 01, 2025 — First Day of School

I created this repo to document my learning progress as an interactive learner in Maestro AI University’s AAS in AI Software Engineering. This space captures my transition into a future AI/UX career. Every folder represents a stage of growth — not just lines of code, but the evolution of how I think, experiment, and build.

📂 Repository Structure
- notes/
  Course notes, concepts, explanations, and summaries written in my own words.
  (Shows real understanding, not memorization.)
- projects/
  Small coding projects, practice exercises, and experiments.
  (Reflects my interactive, hands-on learning style.)
- scratchpad/
  A testing area for quick code snippets, trials, and ideas.
  (Where I explore, break things, and learn by doing.)

🎨 My Learning Style
I learn best through interaction. I understand concepts faster when I can:
- test ideas hands-on
- see results immediately
- adjust code and watch changes
- learn through trial, feedback, and iteration
This repo reflects that approach: practical, experimental, and growth-focused.

🎯 Long-Term Goal
To grow into a Conversational AI Designer or AI/UX Researcher — combining:
- human behavior understanding
- user interaction design
- AI co-thinking frameworks
- the technical skills I build throughout this journey
This repository is the first step in that transformation.

📝Progress Log
- Week 1: Python basics — variables, booleans, comparisons  
- Week 2: Control flow — " if/elif/else ", string membership (in / not in)
-  Week 2: Strings, Lists, Dictionaries, and Safe Data Handling
