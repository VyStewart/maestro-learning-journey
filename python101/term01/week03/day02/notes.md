### Lesson: String skills upgrade ii: common methods
### Date : 12-16-2025

## Key Concepts Learned

. String methods provide reusable, readable operations
. Strings are immutable; methods return new strings
. Whitespace includes spaces, tabs, and newlines
. .strip(), .lstrip(), .rstrip() remove surrounding whitespace
. .lower() standardizes text to lowercase
. .replace() modifies string content
. .find() locates substrings by index
. .split() converts a string into a list of pieces

## Important Rules to Remember
. Methods do not modify the original string
. .find() returns -1 if not found
. .split() defaults to splitting on whitespace
. .replace() requires both target and replacement
. Trimming only removes from the edges, not the middle

## Short Reflection
Today I learned how to clean, transform, search, and break apart strings using built-in methods. I’m starting to see when to use methods instead of slicing and how each method serves a specific role in text processing.
