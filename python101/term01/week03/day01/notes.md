### Lesson: String skills upgrade i: Indexing and slicing
### Date 12-15-2025

## Key Concepts Learned
 .Strings use zero-based indexing
 .Indexing accesses a single character
 .Slicing extracts a range of characters
 .Slice syntax: start : stop : step
 .Negative indexes count from the end of the string
 .Step allows skipping characters or reversing direction

## Important Rules to Remember
 .Index 0 is always the first character
 .Slice includes start, excludes stop
 .Omitted start defaults to the beginning
 .Omitted stop defaults to the end
 .Step controls how many characters are skipped
 .Negative step moves backward through the string

## Short Reflection
Today I strengthened my understanding of how strings are indexed and sliced in Python. I can predict how Python selects characters using start, stop, and step, and I’m beginning to see how slicing becomes powerful when combined with negative indexes.
