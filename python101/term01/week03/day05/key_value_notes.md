### Lesson: Dictionaries i: Keys and Values
### Date: 12-21-2025

Key Concepts Learned
-Dictionaries store data as key–value pairs
-Keys act as labels; values hold the associated data
-Dictionaries prioritize meaning over position
-Data is accessed using keys, not indexes

Important Rules to Remember
-Dictionaries use curly braces{} with key: value pairs separatedly by commas
-Acces(read) a value using square brackets with the key
    . Dict[key]
-Add a new key-value pair using the same bracket syntax with a new key
    . Dict[key] = value
-The same syntax doesis used to add and update entries
-Accessing a missing key raises a KeyError
-Dictionaries do not return None automatically
-Keys must be unique and immutable
    . Valid key types: "string", ints, floats, bools
    . Invalid key types: lists, dicts
-Values can be any data type
-Dictionaries help prevent errors caused by shifting indexes

Short Reflection
Today I learned how dictionaries organize data using keys and values instead of positions. I understand that keys act as anchors for meaning and why missing keys raise errors. This helped me see why dictionaries are safer and more reliable than lists when data grows or changes.
