# Week 02

## Thinking, Observations, and Learning Process

---

## Purpose

This scratchpad captures **raw thinking**, questions, and observations while learning.
It is not polished and does not need to be correct.

---

## Questions That Came Up

* Why does `is` sometimes behave inconsistently?
* Why did nested `if` statements print multiple outputs?
* Why does `continue` skip code but not stop the loop?
* Why do counters and totals start at zero?

---

## Observations

* Most bugs came from misunderstanding execution order.
* Indentation reflects logic, not formatting.
* Python evaluates current state, not real-world assumptions.

---

## Patterns I Used Repeatedly

* Accumulators using `+=`
* Filtering with `continue`
* Early exit with `break`
* Refactoring nested `if`s into `elif`

---

## Learning Style Notes

* Writing code first helps understanding.
* Refining after verification makes concepts stick.
* Short explanations + interaction work best.

---

## Meta-Learning Notes

* Predicting output before running code improves reasoning.
* Clean notes at the end of the day reinforce memory.
* Separating notes, scratchpad, and practice keeps learning organized.

---

## Open Questions (Optional)

* When to prefer `while` vs `for` in real projects
* How these patterns scale in larger programs
* How decision tables help in complex logic
