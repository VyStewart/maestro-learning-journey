**Modulo-Checking for Multiples**
- Modulo operator (%) checks the remainder after division. If a number
  devides evenly with no remainder, it is a multiple.
    - Remainder = 0 -> clean division -> multiple
    - Remainder # 0 -> not a multiple
- Modulo is also used to filter number by divisibility
- Example: filter number ending with 4
    - number % 10 == 4
- % 10 checks the last digit of a number; == includes that digit, != excludes it.

**while loop**
- In a while loop, changing value without assignment does nothing, and failing
  to update the loop variable every iteration cause infinitive loop. The update
  should be unconditional and clearly visible to prevent infinitive loops.
