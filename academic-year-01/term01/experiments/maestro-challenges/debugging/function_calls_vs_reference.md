# Function calls vs reference

**Functions Are Values**
- In Python, a sunction is a value that can be:
    - stored in a variable
    - passed as an argument
    - return from another function
    - called later

- A function name is just a reference to a function object.
- Writing a function name without parentheses does not run the function.
- passing a function into another function passes the reference, not the result.
- Python will only execute a function when:
    - parentheses () are used
    - the function reference is explicitly called

**Comparison**
- function reference -> behavior passed around
    - A function reference allows behavior to be executed later.

- function call -> behavior excuted
    - A function call executes behavior immediately.
