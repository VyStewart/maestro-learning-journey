**Function - Early return**

In a function, printing an error massage does not stop a function
Python will keep executing until it:
- hits a return
- hits an exception
- reaches the end of the function

An early return is a return statement used before the normal end of the
function to stop execution when a condition is met.

An early return is used to immediately exit a function when a condion
makes the rest of the code unsafe to run.
