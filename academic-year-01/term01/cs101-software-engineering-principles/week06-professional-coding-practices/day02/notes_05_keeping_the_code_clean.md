### Lesson 05: Keeping The Code Clean
### Date: Jan 06 2026

Core Principle:
Clean formatting improves readability, reduces cognitive load, and supports correct reasoning about code. Formatting is a fundamental part of professional coding practice, not a cosmetic preference.

1. Why Code Formatting Matters
- Code is read more often than it is written.
- Consistent formatting makes structure and intent immediately visible.
- Clean formatting reduces mental effort and helps prevent logical errors.
- Poor formatting obscures meaning and increases the risk of mistakes during maintenance.

2. Whitespace as a Communication Tool
- Whitespace provides visual structure and separation.
- Line breaks organize logical steps.
- Indentation conveys hierarchy and control flow.
- Proper spacing acts like punctuation in written language, guiding the reader.

3. Space After Commas
- Adding space after commas improves readability in lists, arguments, and collections.
- Clear separation makes individual elements easier to scan and understand.
- Consistent spacing supports quick comprehension of function calls and data structures.

4. Space Around Operators
- Spacing around operators clarifies expressions and conditions.
- Well-spaced operators make logic easier to interpret at a glance.
- Proper spacing reduces misreading of complex expressions.

5. Professional Standard
- Clean formatting is an industry expectation.
- Readable code reflects discipline and attention to detail.
- Formatting consistency enables effective collaboration and code review.

Short Reflection
This lesson reinforces that how code looks directly affects how well it is understood. Clean formatting supports clear thinking, accurate reasoning, and long-term maintainability. Treating formatting as a professional standard—not a personal choice—helps ensure that code communicates clearly to anyone who reads it.
