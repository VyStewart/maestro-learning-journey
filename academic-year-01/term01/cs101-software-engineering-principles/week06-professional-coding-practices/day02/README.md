# Professional Coding Practices


This folder contains all lessons and practice files for **Day 02**, focusing on writing cleaner, more readable, and more maintainable Python code. The main goal of this day is to move from “code that works” to **code that communicates intent clearly**.

---

## Lessons Overview

### Lesson 04 – Writing Comments with Purpose

**File:** `04_writing_comments_with_purpose.py`

This lesson focuses on *why* we write comments, not just *how*.

**Key ideas:**

* Comments should explain **why** something is done, not restate obvious code
* Avoid unnecessary or redundant comments
* Use comments to clarify intent, assumptions, or decisions

---

### Lesson 05 – Keeping the Code Clean

**File:** `05_keeping_the_code_clean.py`

This lesson introduces clean coding habits that improve readability.

**Key ideas:**

* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Remove unused code and unnecessary variables
* Keep logic simple and easy to follow

---

### Lesson 06 – Making Code Readable

**File:** `06_making_code_readable.py`

This lesson focuses on making code easy for other humans (and future you) to understand.

**Key ideas:**

* Proper spacing and indentation
* Logical ordering of code
* Writing code that reads like a story

---

### Lesson 07 – Turning Long Scripts into Sharp Functions

**File:** `07_turning_long_scripts_to_sharp_functions.py`

This lesson demonstrates how to refactor a long script into smaller, reusable functions.

**Key ideas:**

* Breaking large scripts into focused functions
* Using `return` instead of printing inside functions
* Separating input, processing, and output
* Writing functions that do one thing well

**Functions created include:**

* Getting user input
* Determining age groups
* Calculating years until 100
* Printing a formatted summary

---

**Applying Professional Structure**

**Files:**

* `notes_04_writing_comments_with_purpose.md`
* `notes_05_keeping_the_code_clean.md`
* `notes_06_making_code_readable.md`
* `notes_07_turning_long_scripts_to_sharp_functions.md`

These notes reinforce best practices and summarize each lesson’s main concepts.

## Learning Outcome

By the end of Day 02, I learned how to:

* Write purposeful comments
* Improve readability through clean structure
* Refactor long scripts into reusable functions
* Use return values instead of printing inside functions
* Think like a software engineer, not just a programmer
