### Lesson 06: Making Code Readable
### Date: Jan 06 2026

Core Principle:
Readable code allows a reader to quickly understand what the code does, why it exists, and how it is structured—without additional explanation.

1. Meaning at a Glance
- Instantly readable code communicates intent immediately.
- A reader should not need to mentally simulate execution to understand purpose.
- Clear structure and naming allow understanding through simple scanning.

2. Reducing Cognitive Load
- Readable code minimizes how much information the reader must hold in memory.
- Logic should be understandable locally, not dependent on distant context.
- Simpler, clearer structures reduce mental effort and error risk.

3. Small, Clear Units of Logic
- Code should be broken into small, focused sections.
- Each unit should perform one clear responsibility.
- Logical progression should feel sequential, not tangled.

4. Readability Is System-Wide
- Instant readability emerges from the combination of:
- Clear naming (what)
- Docstrings (why)
- Comments (decisions and constraints)
- Formatting and spacing (structure)
- No single element creates readability on its own.

5. Professional Readability Standard
- Code should be understandable by someone unfamiliar with it.
- Fast comprehension is a baseline professional expectation.
- Readable code is safer to change, review, and extend.

Short Reflection
This lesson reinforces that professional code is written for readers, not just for execution. Instant readability reduces mistakes, speeds collaboration, and builds trust in the codebase. By prioritizing clarity and structure, code becomes easier to reason about and safer to maintain over time.
