### Lesson 08: Following Program Flow With Print Tracing
### Date: Jan 08 2026

Core Principle:
Print tracing is a technique used to make program execution visible, allowing developers to observe control flow, decision paths, and repetition step by step.

1. Purpose of Print Tracing
- Print tracing externalizes how a program runs.
- It helps confirm assumptions about execution order and logic.
- Tracing is a reasoning tool, not just a debugging tactic.

2. Tracing Function Entry and Exit
- Functions introduce non-linear execution.
- Tracing entry shows when a function is called.
- Tracing exit shows when control returns to the caller.
- This reinforces the distinction between function definition and function execution.

3. Tracing Conditional Logic (if / else)
- Tracing reveals which branch is executed.
- It validates whether conditions behave as expected.
- This helps catch logic errors caused by incorrect assumptions.

4. Tracing Loop Execution
- Tracing loops shows iteration count and variable changes.
- It makes repetition and state transitions explicit.
- Loop tracing helps identify off-by-one errors and incorrect stopping conditions.

5. Professional Context
- Tracing develops execution-level thinking.
- It trains developers to reason about behavior, not just outcomes.
- This skill supports debugging, code review, and system comprehension.

Short Reflection
This lesson emphasizes understanding how code actually runs, not just what it produces. Print tracing builds confidence in following execution paths and diagnosing logic errors. While simple, it reinforces a critical habit: validating assumptions through observation.
