### Lesson 03: Crafting Docstrings that explain the why
### Date: Jan 05 2026

Core Principle:
Docstrings explain the purpose and intent of a function. While code shows how something works, docstrings explain why it exists.

1. Role of Docstrings
- A docstring is a form of documentation written for humans, not the computer.
- It describes the problem the function is meant to solve.
- It provides context that cannot be easily inferred from the code itself.
- A good docstring remains useful even if the function’s internal logic changes.

2. Focus on “Why,” Not “How”
- Docstrings should avoid restating implementation details.
- The goal is to explain intent, reasoning, or design decisions.
- Emphasizing why makes the code easier to maintain and refactor.
- Clear intent helps others use the function correctly without reading its internal logic.

3. When a Function Needs a Docstring
- When the function’s purpose is not obvious from its name alone.
- When the function enforces a rule, assumption, or decision.
- When incorrect usage could lead to bugs or unexpected behavior.
- When the function represents an important concept within the program.

4. Docstrings as Professional Practice
- Docstrings signal thoughtful, intentional design.
- They improve collaboration and long-term code quality.
- Well-written docstrings reflect clarity of thinking, not just technical ability.

Short Reflection
This lesson reinforces that professional code is not only about execution, but about communication. Writing docstrings that explain why a function exists encourages deliberate design and clearer thinking. It shifts the mindset from “making the code work” to “making the code understandable and maintainable.”
