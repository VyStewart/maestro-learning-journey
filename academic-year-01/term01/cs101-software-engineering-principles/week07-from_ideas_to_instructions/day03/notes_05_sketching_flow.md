## Lesson 05: Sketching flow
### Date: Jan - 15 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Visualizing program execution paths before coding to clarify order, decisions, loops, and exits.

**Key Concepts**
- Flow sketching maps how a program moves from start to end.
- It focuses on execution order, not syntax.
- Sketches can be informal and text-based.

**Core Flow Elements**
- Start
- Actions
- Decisions
- Loops
- Exit and output

**Why Sketch Flow First**
- Reveals missing exit conditions.
- Prevents misplaced logic.
- Makes control flow easier to reason about.

**Relationship to Earlier Lessons**
- Uses problem steps from decomposition.
- Applies hierarchy through decisions and loops.
- Prepares rules for clean translation into code.

**Key Takeaway**
- If you can see the flow clearly, writing correct code becomes straightforward.

**Short Reflection**
- Sketching flow helped me slow down and see the program as a path instead of lines of code. By visualizing decisions and loops first, I can catch logic issues earlier and code with more confidence and intention.
