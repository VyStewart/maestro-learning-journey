## Lesson 03: Hierachy in Pseudocode
### Date: Jan - 14 - 2026

**Core Focus**
Using numbers and indentation in pseudocode to represent execution order and logical hierarchy before coding.

**Key Concepts**
- Pseudocode should reflect both sequence and structure.
- Not all steps are equal; some steps contain others.
- Hierarchy must be visible before writing code.

1. Numbers vs. Indentation
- Numbers show execution order.
- Indentation shows scope and dependency.
- Together, they mirror real program structure.

2. Why Hierarchy Matters
- Prevents scope-related logic errors.
- Clarifies conditional and loop behavior.
- Makes complex logic readable and predictable.

3. Practical Guideline
- Write top-level steps as numbered items.
- Indent sub-steps under the step they depend on.
- If indentation is unclear, stop and fix the plan before coding.

**Key Takeaway**
If the hierarchy is unclear in pseudocode, it will be unclear—and likely wrong—in code.

**Short Reflection**
This lesson helped me see why some bugs feel invisible while coding. Without clear hierarchy, I may understand the steps but misplace them logically. Using numbers and indentation forces me to slow down, see scope clearly, and write code that follows the intended structure instead of guessing.
