## Lesson 12: Creating test tables for pseudocode plans
### Date: Jan 17 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Using assert statements to verify pseudocode rules and logic decisions early in development.

**Key Concepts**
- A test table maps inputs to expected outputs.
- assert checks whether code behavior matches planned rules.
- Tests validate logic, not syntax.

**Why Use assert**
- Immediate feedback on correctness
- Encourages boundary and edge-case thinking
- Acts as executable documentation

**How to Build a Test Table**
- Identify core rules from pseudocode.
- Choose representative inputs, including edge cases.
- Write one assert per rule or boundary.

**Key Takeaway**
- If the plan is correct, the asserts will pass. If an assert fails, either the plan or the logic is wrong—and both are easier to fix early.

**Short Reflection**
- This lesson showed me that testing doesn’t have to be heavy or complicated. By turning rules into simple asserts, I can confirm my thinking before building more logic. It also helps me catch edge cases I might otherwise overlook.
