## Lesson 11: Building code incrementally
### Date: Jan 17 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Developing programs in small, testable increments using placeholders and rapid feedback loops.

**Key Concepts**
- Start with a running program, even if incomplete.
- Use hard-coded placeholders to validate structure.
- Replace placeholders with real logic gradually.

**Incremental Development Cycle**
- Define
- Call
- Print
- Edit
- Run
Repeat until the program behaves correctly.

**Why This Works**
- Reduces debugging complexity
- Keeps progress visible
- Makes errors easier to locate

**Key Takeaway**
- Progress comes from small, verified steps—not from writing everything at once.

**Short Reflection**
- This lesson helped me shift from “finishing code” to “growing code.” By using placeholders and following a tight edit–run cycle, I can keep my program running at all times and reduce stress while building correct logic.
