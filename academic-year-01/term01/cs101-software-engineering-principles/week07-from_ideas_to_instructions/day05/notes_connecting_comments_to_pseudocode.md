### Week07: From ideas to instruction
## Lesson 09: Kepping comments that connect to pseudocode
### Date: Jan 17 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Using comments to preserve planning intent by linking code directly to pseudocode steps.

**Key Concepts**
- Comments should explain intent, not syntax.
- Pseudocode provides a stable reference for comments.
- Plan-linked comments remain useful as code evolves.

**Commenting Guidelines**
- Reference steps or rules from the plan.
- Group comments by logical blocks, not individual lines.
- Avoid restating obvious code behavior.

**Why This Matters**
- Makes code easier to reason about.
- Simplifies debugging and refactoring.
- Preserves alignment between plan and implementation.

**Key Takeaway**
- Comments are part of the plan. If they don’t reflect intent, they add little value.

**Short Reflection**
- This lesson helped me rethink comments as anchors to my thinking rather than explanations of Python. By keeping comments aligned with pseudocode, I can return to my code later and immediately understand why each section exists, not just what it does.
