## Lesson 15: Demonstrating the working app
### Date: Jan 18 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Proving that a complete application works by validating core logic with assert statements.

**Key Concepts**
- Logic should be isolated in testable functions.
- Interactive input is difficult to test automatically.
- assert statements demonstrate correctness mechanically.

**Demonstration Pattern**
- Write core logic as a pure function.
- Build the app around that logic.
- Use assert to verify expected behavior.
- Let passing tests confirm correctness.

**Why This Matters**
- Prevents silent logic bugs.
- Makes refactoring safer.
- Builds confidence based on proof, not assumption.

**Key Takeaway**
- A working app is not just one that runs—it is one that can prove it behaves correctly.

**Short Reflection**
- This lesson helped me see testing as part of demonstrating my thinking, not just checking results. By using asserts, I can show that my app works correctly across scenarios without manually re-running it. It makes my code feel more professional and trustworthy.
