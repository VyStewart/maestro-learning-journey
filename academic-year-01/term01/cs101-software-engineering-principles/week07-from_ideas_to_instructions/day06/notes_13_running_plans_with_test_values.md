## Lesson 13: Running plans with test values
### Date: Jan 18 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Validating pseudocode logic by manually simulating execution using test-table values.

**Key Concepts**
- Dry running means stepping through logic without executing code.
- Test tables provide concrete inputs and expected outputs.
- Rule order determines execution outcome.

**Dry Run Process**
- Assign the test input.
- Evaluate each rule in order.
- Stop when a rule matches.
- Compare the result to the expected output.

**Why This Works**
- Finds logic errors early.
- Reduces trial-and-error coding.
- Strengthens understanding of control flow.

**Key Takeaway**
- If a plan fails during a dry run, it will fail in code—dry running catches the problem sooner and cheaper.

**Short Reflection**
- Dry running helped me slow down and trust the plan instead of rushing to code. Walking through each rule with a test value made the logic feel concrete and predictable, and it showed me that many bugs can be caught before Python is even involved.
