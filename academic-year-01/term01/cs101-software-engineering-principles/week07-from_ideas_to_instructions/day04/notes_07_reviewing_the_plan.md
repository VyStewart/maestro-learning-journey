### Week07: From ideas to instruction
## Lesson 07: Reviewing the plan
### Date: Jan - 16 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Identifying logical and structural problems in a plan before writing code.

**Key Concepts**
- Planning errors are easier to fix than coding errors.
- Reviewing the plan prevents wasted implementation effort.
- Structural clarity matters more than syntax correctness.

 **What to Review**
- Completeness of steps
- Correct execution order
- Proper placement of rules
- Clear exit conditions
- Alignment between final step and required output

**Review Checklist**
- Does the plan fully match the prompt?
- Are decisions and loops clearly placed?
- Is the output clearly defined?
- Can someone else follow the plan?

**Key Takeaway**
- If the plan is flawed, the code will be flawed—even if it runs.

**Short Reflection**
- This lesson reinforced that confidence in coding comes from confidence in the plan. Taking a moment to review structure and flow helps me catch mistakes early and reduces rework. It also shifts my mindset from “fix it in code” to “get it right before coding.”
