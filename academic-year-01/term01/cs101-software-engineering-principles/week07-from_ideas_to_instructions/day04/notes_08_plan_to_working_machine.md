## Lesson 07: From plan to working machine
### Date: Jan - 16 - 2026

**Core Focus**
- Translating a reviewed plan into a correct, predictable program.

**Key Concepts**
- Code is an execution of a plan, not an improvisation.
- A correct plan leads to mechanical, low-stress coding.
- Output validates the plan.

**Plan-to-Code Pipeline**
- Understand the prompt
- Break into steps
- Identify rules
- Sketch flow
- Review the plan
- Translate directly into code

**Why This Matters**
- Prevents logic bugs
- Reduces refactoring
- Produces reliable behavior

**Key Takeaway**
- When the plan is correct, the code becomes simple and trustworthy.

**Short Reflection**
- This lesson helped me see coding as the final step, not the creative one. Once the plan is solid, writing code feels calm and mechanical. That shift makes programming more reliable and less emotionally reactive.
