## Lesson 01: Balancing planning and coding
### Date: Jan - 12 - 2026

Core Focus
Learning how to balance upfront thinking with active coding—planning just enough to write clear, correct code without falling into over-engineering or impulsive implementation.

1. Key Concepts
- Planning and coding are iterative, not separate phases.
- The amount of planning required depends on:
    - Problem size
    - Complexity
    - Risk of change
- Even “just start coding” requires a minimal plan.

2. Practical Planning Baseline
Before writing code, be able to answer:
- What is the goal?
- What are the inputs?
- What is the expected output?
- What are the likely failure cases?
Once these are clear, coding can begin—even if details are incomplete.

3. When Light Planning Is Enough
- Small, self-contained functions
- Familiar logic or patterns
- Low cost of rewriting
- Exploratory or learning-focused code

In these cases:
- Code serves as a draft
- Refactoring is expected
- Mistakes are part of the process

4. When More Planning Is Required
- Multiple functions interact
- Data flows across several steps
- Validation and error handling matter
- Uncertainty increases while coding
Pausing to clarify structure at this stage prevents fragile design.

5. Common Pitfalls
- ver-planning: delays progress and creates incorrect abstractions.
- Under-planning: leads to tangled logic and hard-to-fix errors.

Key Takeaway
Plan just enough to start with clarity, then let coding refine and improve the plan.

Short Reflection
At first, “balancing planning and coding” felt abstract, but this lesson clarified that planning is not about perfection—it is about readiness. I learned to recognize when I have enough clarity to start and when uncertainty is a signal to pause. This mindset reduces both hesitation and rework, and it supports writing cleaner, more intentional code.
