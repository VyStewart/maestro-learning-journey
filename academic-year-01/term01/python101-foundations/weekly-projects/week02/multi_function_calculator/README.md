### Multi-Function Calculator — Week 02

This project is an expansion of the **Week 01 Multi-Function Calculator**.

## Context
In Week 01, this calculator was built using:
- variables
- user input
- arithmetic operations
- basic conditional logic
- formatted output

The focus was on **procedural flow** and understanding Python fundamentals.

## Week 02 Goal
In Week 02, the goal is to **refactor and expand** the existing calculator using:

- Functions and scope isolation
- Menu-driven control flow (while / break / continue)
- Early return for validation
- Logical branching and decision tables
- Loop usage (for / while, counters, totals)

No new features are added initially.
Instead, existing logic from Week 01 is reorganized into functions to improve:
- readability
- reusability
- structure
- maintainability

## Structure

- `practice.py`  
  Used for experimenting with refactors and testing function logic.
- `main.py`  
  Contains the clean, finalized Week 02 version of the calculator.

## Versioning Note
The Week 01 version is preserved in:
`term01/week01/multi_function_calculator/`

This Week 02 folder represents the **next iteration**, not a replacement.
