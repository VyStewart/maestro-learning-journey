### Lesson: Lists
### Date: 12-17-2025

## Key Concepts Learned
-Lists are ordered, mutable collections
-List indexing uses zero-based positions
-Indexing retrieves or replaces a single item
-List slicing uses start:stop:step
-Slicing returns a new list
-Slicing can also replace multiple items at once

## Important Rules to Remember
-Last valid index = len(list) - 1
-Indexing outside the list raises IndexError
-Slicing never raises IndexError
-Lists can be modified directly; strings cannot
-Prefer slicing when working with ranges of items

## Short Reflection
Today I learned how to safely access and modify lists using indexing and slicing. I understand why slicing is more forgiving than indexing and how this helps prevent errors. I’m becoming more intentional about choosing the safest way to update data structures.
