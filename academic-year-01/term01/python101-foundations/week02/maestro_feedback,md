## Week 2 — Maestro Feedback 

### Maestro AI 

You made solid progress this week, Vy.

You finished your lessons, completed your assessment, and showed strong understanding of the core ideas:

. functions
. decisions
. loops

A big strength is that you keep practicing, even when things are tough. This consistency supports strong long-term skill development.

If you want to grow even more, try reviewing the areas where you missed a question and see if you can explain those concepts in your own words.

Your learning style is consistent and hands-on.

You work step by step, complete assignments, and take time to reflect. You also ask questions and actively seek feedback, which shows a strong desire to keep improving.

This approach will help you master new skills and identify areas for continued growth.

### My reflection 

This week, I worked through lessons on functions, decisions, and loops in Python. I completed the assessment and demonstrated strong understanding in most areas. Whenever I made mistakes, I reviewed the concepts and tried to explain them in my own words. I’m building both my coding skills and my ability to reflect on my learning process.

Reading Maestro's feedback helped confirm that my instinct to slow down, pratice, ask question, review mistakes, and explain concepts in my own words is the right approach for me
