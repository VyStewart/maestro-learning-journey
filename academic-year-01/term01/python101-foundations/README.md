## 📘 Course Overview

This folder contains coursework, practice, and projects for **Python 101 — Foundations**, an introductory course focused on establishing core programming skills using Python.

The course emphasizes:

* structured problem-solving
* readable, maintainable code
* understanding how foundational programming concepts scale into larger systems

Python serves as the primary instructional language in this term and continues to be applied throughout subsequent computer science coursework.

## 🧪 Weekly Project Approach

This course follows an **iterative project model** rather than isolated weekly assignments.

One project is introduced early and expanded each week to reflect newly learned concepts.

Typical progression:

* **Week 01:** Core logic and basic input/output
* **Week 02:** Functions, control flow, and refactoring
* **Week 03:** Validation, structure, and maintainability

Each iteration represents a checkpoint in both technical skill and design maturity.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

Key topics introduced and reinforced include:

* variables and data types
* booleans and comparisons
* control flow (`if / elif / else`)
* strings, lists, and dictionaries
* basic input validation and safe data handling
* writing clear, readable Python code

---

## 📝 Learning Method

Notes and exercises are written in my own words and maintained alongside code to demonstrate:

* conceptual understanding
* reasoning behind implementation choices
* growth through refactoring and iteration

This approach prioritizes **understanding over memorization** and reflects how concepts are applied in later coursework.
